# interpreter-design
Course Project for CS-315: Theory of Automata.  
<b>Lexer.py</b> contains the tokens used.  
<b>Parser.py</b> defines the parsing rule.  
<b>Interpreter.py</b> is the crux of the project where the commands were interpreted and executed in Python.  
Ply.Lex was used for token/lexical analysis.  
Ply.Yacc was used for syntactical analysis.
